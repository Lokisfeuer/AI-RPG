In order of priority:
TODO: (get it working)
    - build necessary AIs
    - test bot.py file //
    - test main.py main() function //
    - try out real triggers (and fake ones actually as well.) //
    - improve prompts of locations and npcs /
    - write full test adventures (& test them) //
TODO: (make it presentable)
    - fix error warnings /
    - finish all todos.
    - properly organise imports and organise them similar in every file
    - properly name your classes!
    - comment through everything
    - write a real nice read.me /
    - improve beauty of website (/play and /write_adventure)
    - reorganise plan.txt (this file)
TODO: (future plans)
    - save all user entry's
    - write a normal writer function with text only in and out
    - think about multiplayer


An application where you can play roleplay adventures.
    with text ONLY in and output
    you can also write your own adventures others can then play
    it can be called from other programs with an input text and returns the output (website, discord-bot)

    users should be able to incorporate new features and concepts like abilities or time


The game basically consists of
    the player trying to find secrets searching his location and speaking with the npcs.
    Changing locations
    triggers
    At some point: fighting monsters and npcs.

The game.py and adventure.py are good and everything necessary is commented as 'TODO'



WRITER:
messages get in - -> adventure gets written to adventures.json to the users username


SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE:
class PLAYER_CHARACTER:  # for now irrelevant
    def __init__(self):
        pass


class SKILL:  # for now irrelevant
    def __init__(self):
        pass


class SETTING:  # for now irrelevant
    def __init__(self):
        pass


class RULEBOOK:  # for now not that relevant
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    # add fighting
    # add multiplayer (Discord server / group chats)
    # add the possibility to lose the game.
    # all of this comes down to implementing a proper rulebook. D&D seems best for that purpose:
    #   D&D all publications: https://the-eye.eu/public/Books/rpg.rem.uz/Dungeons%20%26%20Dragons/
    #   Open source d&d character generator: https://www.npcgenerator.com/
    #   An equivalent to this for locations. https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=d%26d+location+generator
    #   They need to be intertwined through secrets.
    #   Also, they need to kind of react different on different types of characters.
